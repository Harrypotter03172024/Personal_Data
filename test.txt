Hints
- Your implementation ofthe search method must beagenerator.
- You can use results of search inthe implementation of first method
Examples
1.Example1
Given the following example JSON file:
{ "items": [ [‘0
{"name": "The Shawshank Redemption", "tags": ["963", "drama"]},
{"name": "The Godfather", "tags": ["793", "drama", "crime"]},
{"name": uThe Dark Knight". "tags": ["action", "crime", "drama"]},
{"name": uThe Godfather: Part II", "tags": ["793", "crime", "drama"]},
]
}
If we create the SearchByTag class as follows:
search_1 = SearchByTag(‘movies.json'. 'crime') it!
And we callthe first method as follows:
first = search_1.first()
The following data should be returned:
>>> {"name": "The Godfather", "tags": ["705", "drama", "crime"]} FD
lf we were to call search() multiple times:
data = search_1.search()
In the subsequent iterations we should receive the following data:
>>> {"name": "The Godfather", "tags": ["785", "drama". "crime"l} IE1
>>> {"name": "The Dark Knight", "tags": ["action", "crime", "drama"]}
>>> {"name": "The Godfather: Part II", "tags": ["795", "crime", "drama"]}
If we were to convert the results into a list in the following manner:
data_list = list(se1f .search_1 .search( ))
We would receive the following list:

[{"name": "The Godfather", "tags": ["703", "drama", "crime"]},
{"name": "The Dark Knight" , "tags": ["action", "crime", "drama"]},
{"name": "The Godfather: Part II" , "tags": ["763", "crime" ,"drama"]}]

2 Example 2
Given the following example JSON file:
{ "items" : [
{"name" : "The Shawshank Redemption" },
{"name" : "The Godfather"}
]
}
If we create the SearchByTagclass as follows:
search_2 = SearchByTag( 'movies-no-tags.json' , '90s')
And we call the first method as follows:
first = search_2.first() [El
StopIteration should be raised.
Assumptions
. Python version is 3.8
. Every test is using a valid JSON
